# Openfort Embedded Signer with Third-party Auth 

This is a template for integrating [**Openfort**](https://www.openfort.xyz/) into a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as for authentication. Check out the deployed app [here](https://create-next-app.openfort.xyz/)!

This demo uses NextJS's [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing).

## How to run locally

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

Copy the .env.local.example file into a file named .env.local in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

To enable your embedded signer, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/guides/javascript/embedded-signer/recovery).

```sh
# In your terminal, create .env.local from .env.example
cp .env.example .env.local

NEXTAUTH_SHIELD_ENCRYPTION_SHARE=
NEXTAUTH_SHIELD_SECRET_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_SHIELD_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLIC_KEY=
```

**2. Create a Policy**

[![Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/REQUIRED-TRUE-ORANGE.svg)](https://shields.io/)

If you want to sponsor transactions, you can add policies to your `.env.local` file. You can create gas sponsorship policies [from your Openfort dashboard](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/guides/dashboard/gas-sponsorship).


```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLICY_ID=
```

**3. Get your Firebase Config**

First go to Firebase config: Console > Project settings > General adn create an app for your prohject if you still don't have one.

Then go to Firebase-Admin config: Console > Project settings > Service accounts and generate a "New Private Key"

Update `.env`

**4. Set up Firebase Auth in Openfort**

To set up Firebase to authenticate players with Openfort, visit your [dashboard provider settings](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/players/auth/providers). You can follow a guide on how to set up Firebase Auth in Openfort [here](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/guides/javascript/auth/external-auth).

</div>

**5. Follow the server instructions on how to run**

Install & Run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

In your project directory, run `npm run dev`. You can now visit http://localhost:3000 to see your app and login with Openfort!
